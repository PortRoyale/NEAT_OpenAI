ENVIRONMENTS: https://gym.openai.com/envs# This is simple 4-joints walker robot environment.




# There are two versions:
#
# - Normal, with slightly uneven terrain.
#
# - Hardcore with ladders, stumps, pitfalls.
#
# Reward is given for moving forward, total 300+ points up to the far end. If the robot falls,
# it gets -100. Applying motor torque costs a small amount of points, more optimal agent
# will get better score.
#
# Heuristic is provided for testing, it's also useful to get demonstrations to
# learn from. To run heuristic:
#
# python gym/envs/box2d/bipedal_walker.py
#
# State consists of hull angle speed, angular velocity, horizontal speed, vertical speed,
# position of joints and joints angular speed, legs contact with ground, and 10 lidar
# rangefinder measurements to help to deal with the hardcore version. There's no coordinates
# in the state vector. Lidar is less useful in normal version, but it works.
#
# To solve the game you need to get 300 points in 1600 time steps.
#
# To solve hardcore version you need 300 points in 2000 time steps.
